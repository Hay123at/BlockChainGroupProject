Message Calls
     message call refers to how contracts interact with other contracts or externally owned accounts (EOAs). 
 
A message call occurs when:
    A contract calls a function of another contract.
    A transaction is sent to a contract (from another contract or an EOA).

It includes:
    Sender address (msg.sender)
    Data (function name + arguments)
    Ether value (msg.value)
    Gas limit

Message Call Breakdown
   When a contract receives a message call, Solidity exposes these:
     msg.sender → who called the function
     msg.value → how much Ether was sent
     msg.data → calldata (function + arguments)
     msg.sig → first 4 bytes of msg.data (function selector)

How Do EOAs and Contracts Call Other Contracts?
   Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) and Smart Contracts can call or interact with other smart contracts
      -They use the `address` of the contract they want to communicate with
      -This is a data type in solidity that is 20 bytes long
      -The `msg.sender` from the previous slide is an address
