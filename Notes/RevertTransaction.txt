Reverting Transactions:
    In Solidity, a transaction reverts when an error occurs, 
    undoing all state changes and returning gas not used for execution. 
    This ensures no partial updates happen.

Message Call Revert in Solidity
    message calls can fail, and when they do, they can revert.
    A revert means that the entire transaction is rolled back, including all state changes, and an error is returned.
