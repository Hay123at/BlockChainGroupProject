voting
  voting refers to a decentralized decision-making mechanism implemented in smart contracts,
  allowing participants (e.g., token holders or DAO members) to cast votes on proposals,
  with outcomes determined by predefined rules such as majority support or weighted voting based on stake.
  A typical voting contract includes functions to create proposals, record votes (with checks to prevent double-voting), tally results, and execute approved actions, ensuring transparency and immutability on the blockchain. Common implementations 
  range from simple yes/no voting (e.g., vote(uint proposalId)) to complex governance systems (like OpenZeppelinâ€™s Governor), with security considerations like access control and gas optimization to prevent 
  manipulation or inefficiency. This mechanism is widely used in DAOs, DeFi protocols, and 
  decentralized governance to enable community-driven decisions without intermediaries.
