Arrays:
 Arrays in Solidity store multiple values of the same type, either with fixed or dynamic size, and allow indexed access to elements.
Reference Types: 
 Complex data types (like arrays, structs, mappings) that store references to data rather than the data itself.

Storage: 
 Permanent data location on the blockchain; variables stored here persist between function calls.

Calldata: 
 Temporary, read-only data location for function inputs; used in external calls.

Memory: 
 Temporary data location used during function execution; data is erased after the function ends.
